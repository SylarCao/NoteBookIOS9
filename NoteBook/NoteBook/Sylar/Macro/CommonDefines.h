 我在这已经等待很久了。我不确定他是什么时候会来，唯一能做的便是等待。起初，我对这一切并不在意，毫不关心他的到来，我 还有很多事要做。可渐渐的，我明白了我必须等待他的到来，而且他也一定会来。我无法得知他的行程，他到哪儿了，大概会是什么时间。我所能做的，便是在无尽的时间中等待，同时竭尽全力地编织我的围巾。 我开始回忆起从前的一些片段，有趣的，和不太有趣的。比如和曾经的男朋友在仲夏的夜晚散步回家，我们讨论了诗歌和辛波斯卡；还有冬天吃冰激凌，不再是贪图一时凉爽，而可以尽情体会浓郁的奶香和反季节水果芬芳的乐趣；开始刮秋风时生长速度就会变得异常缓慢的头发，掉落频率却高得惊奇；当然不会少了那件毕业时买的衬衣，二十三岁时我常穿着它和我的哥哥们去喝酒。当我用越来越迟钝的脑子去费力回忆这些事时，我知道衰老在向我走近。 后来，我的门被不断敲响，但我没有轻易开门。我确信，对于他的到来，我是有预感的。我的毛线就要用完，漫长的等待一点一点消耗我的力气，我不再感到恐惧，不再有太多话要说，不再吃大量的甜食，不再对所有事情抱有乐观的想法。每个人都会在这些的等待中，变成自己年轻时毫不在意的那类人。 终于，我手上的围巾织完了，我的门再一次被敲响，这次我毫不犹豫的去开了门。我知道，一定是他来了，跨越了无垠的空间和沉默长久的岁月，他终于来到我面前。 仿若一切回到最开始，幽暗，纯净，安逸，整个世界只存在你一个。你不再焦躁，忧虑和垂头丧气，因为所有的一切都到了尽头。 我们一直等待的，是衰败。死亡。

 I have been waiting here for a long long time. The only thing I can do is to wait although I don't know when he will come. During the past, I didn't care his coming and I didn't care anything about him, since I had many things of my own. However, I gradually come to realize that I should wait for his coming and he will come. I have no idea about where he is and what I can do is to wait in the endless time, weaving my scarf at the same time. Those scenes come out of my memory, interesting, happy, sad and so on such as walking to my home companied by my ex-boyfriend on a summer day, discussing about poesy written by Wislawa Szymborska, eating ice-cream in winter for enjoying the fragrance and interest of the out-of-season fruit, measuring the low-speed growth of the hair in the Fall season and the shirt which impressed me most that I worn when dringking with my brother. I know I am becoming weak and old since I can't remember every detail of those memories. Suddenly, I hear a continuous know at the door, but I don't open the door. I am sure I have a foresee about his coming. I will finish weaving my scarf and the long-time waiting did cost me a lot. I don't fear, I don't talk so much, I don't eat a lot of dessert and I am not optimistic to everything. Everyone will become one of those who they don't want to be at young time. Finally, I finish the scarf and the door is knocked again. I am sure that he comes. He finally comes to my sight after crossing the endless space and time, as everything came to at first. Silence, darkness, purity, safety, it seems you are the entire world of my life. You are no longer rude, anxious nor inconfident, since everything has become to an end. What we are waiting are aging and death.
